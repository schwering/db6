\title{Space-Efficient B\textsuperscript{+}-Tree for Bounded-Length Entries}
\author{Christoph Schwering\\{schwering@gmail.com}}

\begin{document}


\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
A B-tree is an order-preserving index structure for block oriented storage
devices, because each node of the tree can reside on a single block.
The B-tree was first described by Bayer and McCreight \cite{Bayer}.
Several variants of the B-tree appeared in the aftermath, in particular the
B\textsuperscript{+}-tree \cite{Cormen, KnuthBTree}, which differs from the
B-tree in that it carries the values only in its leaves.

This paper proposes a B\textsuperscript{+}-tree (which will be called B-tree for
short in the following) that is capable of storing bounded-length
key/value-entries without wasting space and without the need of overflow spaces.
This is achieved by restricting the entries to a maximum length of
$\tfrac{1}{4}$ of a block's size and posting the invariant that each node except
for the root is filled by a degree of at least $\tfrac{3}{8}$ with entries.

This idea has been mentioned shortly by Knuth \cite{KnuthBTree}, but it seems
to the me that concrete length-bounds and node-invariants have not been
published.
The reason for this probably is that it is trivial for smart people, but sadly
it's not for me.

\section{Definition} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{defi}
A {\em node} $N$ is a set \mbox{$\{ e_1, \ldots, e_d \}$} of entries. 
The degree of $N$ is the count of entries \mbox{$deg(N) = d$}.

Besides the entries, there is some meta data $meta(N)$ that contains the
degree $deg(N)$, the neighbors' addresses $left(N)$ and $right(N)$ and its
parent's address $parent(N)$.
If such a neighbor or parent nodes does not exist, the respective value is
$\bot$.

The form of an entry depends on the position of the node.
An entry $e_i$ of a {\em inner node} consists of
\begin{itemize}
\item a key value $key(e_i)$,
\item an address $child(e_i)$.
\end{itemize}
An entry $e_i$ of a {\em leaf node} consists of
\begin{itemize}
\item a key value $key(e_i)$, and
\item a data value $value(e_i)$.
\end{itemize}
For inner nodes, we write \mbox{$e = (k, a)$} and for leaf nodes 
\mbox{$e = (k, v)$}.
If the context permits it, we do not distinguish between addresses and nodes,
i.e. \mbox{$parent(child(e_i)) = N$}, for example.
\end{defi}

\begin{defi}
A {\em B-tree} is defined over a domain $K$ of keys that is
fully ordered by \mbox{$\leq \ \subseteq K \times K$} and a domain $V$ of
values.
We write \mbox{$e_i \leq e_j$} in the following iff
\mbox{$key(e_i) \leq key(e_j)$}.
The B-tree supports the operations {\em insertion}, {\em deletion} and 
{\em search}. We can define these operations by looking at the states of the
tree:
\begin{itemize}
\item In state $S_0$, the B-tree is empty and for all $k$,
    \mbox{$search(S_0, k) = \bot$} (i.e. no value $v$ for $k$ can be found).
\item In a state $S_i$, the operation \mbox{$insert(S_i, k, v)$} reaches a
    state $S_{i+1}$ in which \mbox{$search(S_{i+1}, k) = v$},
    if \mbox{$search(S_i, k) = \bot$}. Otherwise, the insertion fails and the
    B-tree state does not change.
\item In a state $S_i$, the operation \mbox{$delete(S_i, k)$} returns $v$ and
    reaches a state $S_{i+1}$ in which \mbox{$search(S_{i+1}, k) = \bot$}.
\end{itemize}
In all states, the key condition which makes searching efficient must hold
for all nodes $N$ in the B-tree:
\begin{align*}
\forall e \in N: \ & child(e) = N'\\
     \Rightarrow \ & \forall e' \in N': e' \leq e.
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Size Limits}
Normal B-trees require their nodes to have a certain fixed
minimum and maximum degree, because each node is intended to be stored in one
hard disk block of size $B$ (typically $4096$ bytes).
In contrast, our B-tree requires each node's storage space to be used to a
minimum.
This enables the B-tree to support {\em keys and values of variable length}.

Note that for all nodes $N$, $size_\text{meta} = size(meta(N))$ is constant,
and for all child addresses $a$, $size_\text{addr} = size(a)$ is constant.

We write $\Beff = B - size_\text{meta}$ for the effective node size and leave
out the size of meta data in $size(N) = \sum_{e \in N} size(e)$ because we
always compare it to $\Beff$.
For each $e \in N$, the size is determined by
\[ size(e) = \begin{cases}
size(k) + size_\text{addr} & \text{if } e = (k,a)\\
size(k) + size(v)          & \text{if } e = (k,v)
\end{cases}. \]

Finally, we require for each node $N$ to hold the requirements depicted in
figure~\ref{fill}.
\end{defi}


\begin{defi}
A node is {\em valid} iff it meets the requirements of figure~\ref{fill}.
\end{defi}


\begin{rem}
Note that req.~\ref{maxsize} refers to a node element $e$ which consists
of either \mbox{$e = (k, a)$} or \mbox{$e = (k, v)$}.
It follows that the {\em maximum key size} is
\begin{align*}
size(k) + size_\text{addr}
    &\leq \lfloor \tfrac{1}{4} \Beff \rfloor & \text{ and}\\
size(k) + size(v)
    &\leq \lfloor \tfrac{1}{4} \Beff \rfloor.
\end{align*}
Hence, if the size $size(v)$ of all data values $v$ is bounded by
$size_\text{value}$, the maximum key size is bounded as follows:
\[ size(k) \leq \lfloor \tfrac{1}{4} \Beff \rfloor 
    - \max \{ size_\text{addr}, size_\text{value} \}. \]
\end{rem}


\begin{rem}
The B-tree cannot perform worse than a binary B-tree, because even in the worst
case, each node except for the root node must hold at least two elements.
This is because the minimal node usage is greater than the maximum entry size.
\end{rem}



\section{Theorems} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Let there be a B-tree whose nodes are all valid.
Assume that due to insertion or deletion of an entry, one of the nodes has
become invalid because it violates req.~\ref{maxsize}.
The following theorems show that in all cases the B-tree can
be transformed so that all its nodes are valid again.


\subsection*{Node Overflow}

\begin{thm}
A node with entry set \mbox{$N \cup \{ e \}$} with
\[ size(N) \leq \Beff \text{ but } size(N \cup \{e\}) > \Beff \]
can be split into two nodes such that both fulfill req.~\ref{minsize}.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
For \mbox{$N \cup \{e\} = \{ e_1, \ldots, e_n \}$}, set
\mbox{$L := \{ e_1, \ldots, e_i \}$} such that
\[ size(L) \geq \lfloor \tfrac{3}{8} \Beff \rfloor \text{ but }
    size(L \setminus \{e_i\}) < \lfloor \tfrac{3}{8} \Beff \rfloor \]
and \mbox{$R := (N \cup \{e\}) \setminus L$}.
Then the sizes are bounded as follows:
\begin{align*}
size(L) &\stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{\geq} \lfloor \tfrac{3}{8} \Beff \rfloor\\
size(L) &< \lfloor \tfrac{3}{8} \Beff \rfloor
        + \underbrace{size(e_i)}_{\leq \lfloor \frac{1}{4} \Beff \rfloor}
    \leq \lfloor \tfrac{5}{8} \Beff \rfloor\\
size(R) &= \overbrace{size(N \cup \{e\})}^{> \Beff}
        - \overbrace{size(L)}^{< \lfloor \frac{5}{8} \Beff \rfloor}
    > \lceil \tfrac{3}{8} \Beff \rceil\\
size(R) &= \underbrace{size(N \cup \{e\})}_{
            \leq \Beff + \lfloor \frac{1}{4} \Beff \rfloor}
        - \underbrace{size(L)}_{\geq \lfloor \frac{3}{8} \Beff \rfloor}
    \leq \lceil \tfrac{7}{8} \Beff \rceil
\end{align*}
By this, it directly follows that 
\mbox{$\lfloor \tfrac{3}{8} \Beff \rfloor \leq size(L), size(R) \leq \Beff$}, 
i.e.  $L$ and $R$ fulfill req.~\ref{minsize}.
\end{proof}


\subsection*{Node Underflow}

\begin{thm}
When an entry $e$ is removed from a non-root-node with entry set $L$ such that 
$size(L) \geq \lfloor \tfrac{3}{8} \Beff \rfloor$ but
$size(L \setminus \{e\}) < \lfloor \tfrac{3}{8} \Beff \rfloor$, either entries
from a neighbor can be moved or $L$ can be merged with a neighbor.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Let \[\delta := \lfloor \tfrac{3}{8} \Beff \rfloor - size(L \setminus \{e\})\]
be the space in \mbox{$L \setminus \{e\}$} that needs to be filled so that
\mbox{$L \setminus \{e\}$} fulfills req.~\ref{minsize}.
Without loss of generality, we assume that the right neighbor with entry set $R$
of $L$ exists; otherwise, a left neighbor exists and instead of the neighbor's
minimal elements its maximal elements must be moved to $L$.

Depending on $size(R)$, either entries must be moved or nodes must be merged:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If \mbox{$size(R) \leq \lceil \frac{5}{8} \Beff \rceil + \delta$},
the nodes can be merged to a single node
\mbox{$N := (L \setminus \{e\}) \cup R$}:
\begin{align*}
size(N)
    &= \overbrace{size(L \setminus \{e\})}^{
            \geq \lfloor \frac{3}{8} \Beff \rfloor 
                - \lfloor \frac{1}{4} \Beff \rfloor}
        + \overbrace{size(R)}^{
            \geq \lfloor \frac{3}{8} \Beff \rfloor}
    \geq \lfloor \tfrac{3}{8} \Beff \rfloor\\
size(N)
    &= \underbrace{size(L \setminus \{e\})}_{
            \leq \lfloor \frac{3}{8} \Beff \rfloor - \delta}
        + \underbrace{size(R)}_{
            \leq \lceil \frac{5}{8} \Beff \rceil + \delta}
    \leq \Beff
\end{align*}

\item
If \mbox{$size(R) > \lceil \frac{5}{8} \Beff \rceil + \delta$}, a set
\mbox{$S \subseteq R$} must be moved from $R$ to $L$.
We then set \mbox{$L' := (L \setminus \{e\}) \cup S$} and
\mbox{$R' := R \setminus S$}.
The set $S$ must be minimal, i.e.
\[ size(L') \geq \lfloor \tfrac{3}{8} \Beff \rfloor \text{ but }
    size(L' \setminus \max S) < \lfloor \tfrac{3}{8} \Beff \rfloor. \]
It follows that
\[ \delta \leq size(S) < \delta + \lfloor \tfrac{1}{4} \Beff \rfloor. \]
Hence, $L'$ and $R'$ meet req.~\ref{minsize}:
\begin{align*}
size(L')
    &\stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{\geq} \lfloor \tfrac{3}{8} \Beff \rfloor\\
size(L')
    &= \underbrace{size(L \setminus \{e\})}_{
            = \lfloor \frac{3}{8} \Beff \rfloor - \delta}
        + \underbrace{size(S)}_{
            < \delta + \lfloor \frac{1}{4} \Beff \rfloor}
    < \lfloor \tfrac{5}{8} \Beff \rfloor\\
size(R')
    &= \overbrace{size(R)}^{
            > \lceil \frac{5}{8} \Beff \rceil + \delta}
        - \overbrace{size(S)}^{
            < \delta + \lfloor \frac{1}{4} \Beff \rfloor}
    > \lfloor \tfrac{3}{8} \Beff \rfloor\\
size(R')
    &< size(R) \leq \Beff
\end{align*}
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}



\section{Algorithms} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{proc} \label{ins}
To {\em insert} a key-value-pair \mbox{$(k, v)$}, in the first step the
corresponding leaf node is searched (proc~\ref{sea}).
Then the node increase handling (proc.~\ref{inc}) is performed.
\end{proc}


\begin{proc} \label{del}
To {\em delete} a key $k$, in the first step the corresponding
leaf node is searched (proc~\ref{sea}).
If such a leaf is found, the key-value-pair is removed and then the node
decrease handling (proc.~\ref{dec}) is performed.
\end{proc}


\begin{proc} \label{sea}
The {\em search} for a key $k$ can be carried out by performing the following
steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Set $N$ to the root node with \mbox{$N = \{e_1, \ldots, e_d\}$}.
\item \label{sea:loop} Choose \mbox{$n := \arg \max_{i} k \leq key(e_i)$}.
\item If no such $n$ exists
    \begin{itemize}
    \item and the best future position for $k$ is searched,
        set \mbox{$n := deg(N)$} if $N$ is an inner node and
        set \mbox{$n := deg(N) + 1$} if $N$ is a leaf,
    \item and the value for $k$ is searched, exit with an error.
    \end{itemize}
\item If $N$ is a leaf, return $value(e_n)$.
\item Set \mbox{$N := child(e_n)$} and go to step~\ref{sea:loop}.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proc}


\begin{proc} \label{inc}
To {\em handle the increase of a node} $N$, the following options are tried;
each one is only realized if the resulting nodes are valid.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Maybe the node is valid.
\item Try to shift the \mbox{$\min N$ to $left(N)$}.
\item Try to shift the \mbox{$\max N$ to $right(N)$}.
\item Split $N$ into two.
\end{enumerate}
This order chosen to minimize the creation of new nodes (in the first place and
disk accesses in the second place).

These steps are in detail (the synchronization and redistributions are 
described below):
\begin{enumerate}
\item[ad 1.] Write $N$ to its (old) place and synchronize with parent
    (proc.~\ref{sync}).
\item[ad 2.] Redistribute $left(N)$ and $N$ (proc.~\ref{dist},
    redistribution cares about synchronization).
\item[ad 3.] Redistribute $N$ and $right(N)$ (proc.~\ref{dist},
    redistribution cares about synchronization).
\item[ad 4.] Split $N$ to two nodes $L$ and $R$ (proc.~\ref{split}).
    $R$ replaces $N$, while $L$ is a new node.
    If $N$ was root, create a new root node with the entries $L$ and $R$ and
    set their parents appropriately (this is the only moment when the
    {\em B-tree grows in height}).
    Otherwise, insert $L$ into its parent and synchronize $R$ with its parent
    (proc.~\ref{ins} and proc.~\ref{sync}; insertion of $L$ cares about its
    synchronization, note that the insertion of $L$ into $parent(L)$
    {\em might have changed} $parent(R)$).
\end{enumerate}
\end{proc}


\begin{proc} \label{dec}
To {\em handle the decrease of a node} $N$, the following options are tried;
each one is only realized if the resulting nodes are valid.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Maybe $N$ is root and \mbox{$deg(N) \leq 1$}.
\item Try to merge $N$ with $left(N)$.
\item Try to merge $N$ with $right(N)$.
\item Maybe the node is valid.
\item Try to shift \mbox{$\min right(N)$} to $N$.
\item Shift \mbox{$\max left(N)$} to $N$.
\end{enumerate}
The order is chosen to maximize the removal of nodes (in the first place and
disk accesses in the second place).

These steps are in detail (the synchronization and redistributions are 
described below):
\begin{itemize}
\item[ad 1:] If \mbox{$deg(N) = 0$}, do nothing ($N$ must also be a leaf in
    this case).
    If \mbox{$deg(N) = 1$}, remove $N$ and make its single child new root
    unless the root is already a leaf (this is the only moment the 
    {\em B-tree decreases in height}).
\item[ad 2+3:] Let \mbox{$L = left(N)$} and \mbox{$R = N$} respectively
    \mbox{$L = N$} and $R = right(N)$.
    Add the the entries of $L$ to $R$.
    Note that, in general, \mbox{$parent(L) \neq parent(R)$}.
    Synchronize $R$ with $parent(R)$ and delete $L$ from $parent(L)$
    and remove the node $L$ 
    (proc.~\ref{sync} and proc.~\ref{del}; deletion of $L$ cares about its
    synchronization, note that the synchronization of $R$ with $parent(R)$
    {\em might have changed} $parent(L)$).
\item[ad 4:] Write $N$ to its (old) place and synchronize with parent
    (proc.~\ref{sync}).
\item[ad 5:] Redistribute $N$ and $right(N)$ (proc.~\ref{dist},
    redistribution cares about synchronization).
\item[ad 6:] Redistribute $left(N)$ and $N$ (proc.~\ref{dist},
    redistribution cares about synchronization).
\end{itemize}
\end{proc}


\begin{proc} \label{split}
A node \mbox{$N = \{ e_1, \ldots, e_d \}$} is {\em split optimally} into two
nodes $L$ and $R$ at position
\[ \arg \max_n \underbrace{\min_n \{ size(\{e_1, \ldots, e_{n-1}\}),
    size(\{e_n, \ldots, e_d\}) \}}_{=: d(n)}. \]
The following procedure calculates the optimal split position:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Set \mbox{$n := 0$}.
\item \label{split:loop} If \mbox{$d(n) > d(n+1)$}, exit with $n$.
\item Otherwise set \mbox{$n := n + 1$}. 
\item Go to \ref{split:loop}.
\end{enumerate}
Then set \mbox{$L := \{e_1, \ldots, e_{n-1}\}$}
and \mbox{$R := \{e_n, \ldots, e_d\}$}.
Set \mbox{$parent(L) := parent(R) := parent(N)$}, \mbox{$left(L) := left(N)$},
\mbox{$right(L) := R$}, \mbox{$left(R) := L$}, \mbox{$right(R) := right(N)$}.
\end{proc}

\begin{proof}
For the initial setting $n = 1$, $L$ contains no elements.
In the $n$-th iteration, the $n$-th element is moved from $R$ to $L$.
The procedure stops in the $n$-th iteration if the $n+1$-th iteration would
worsen the situation, i.e. would make the smaller node even smaller.
As $L$ grows with each iteration, $R$ would be the smaller node in the
$n+1$-th iteration. In any further iteration, $R$ would become even smaller.
It follows that no further iteration would improve the situation.
\end{proof}


\begin{proc} \label{dist}
To {\em redistribute two nodes} $L$ and $R$, they are firstly combined two
a single node $N$ (which is overflown).
Then $N$ is split optimally to $L'$ and $R'$ (proc.~\ref{split}).
Note that either children move from $L$ to $R'$ or from $R$ to $L'$.
Synchronize $L$ and $R$ with $parent(L)$ and $parent(R)$ (proc.~\ref{sync};
note that the synchronization of $L$ with $parent(L)$ {\em might have changed}
$parent(R)$).
\end{proc}


\begin{proc} \label{sync}
The following procedure {\em synchronizes a node} $N$ {\em with its parent}
$P = parent(N)$.
Let \mbox{$e_i \in P$} with \mbox{$child(e_i) = N$} be the entry of
$N$ in $P$.
The main task of the synchronization is to set \mbox{$key(e_i) := key(\max N)$}.
Let $e_i'$ be the entry $e_i$ before its modifications.

The modifications might have the effect that the $P$ is {\em not valid anymore}:
\begin{itemize}
\item If \mbox{$size(key(\max N)) < size(key(e_i'))$},
    $P$ might violate req.~\ref{minsize} after the update.
    A node decrease handling (proc.~\ref{dec}) of $P$ must be performed.
\item If \mbox{$size(key(\max N)) > size(key(e_i'))$},
    $P$ might violate req.~\ref{maxsize} after the update.
    A node increase handling (proc.~\ref{inc}) of $P$ must be performed.
\item Otherwise, $P$ must be written back and, if $i = deg(N)$ and
    $key(e_i) \neq key(e_i')$, $P$ must be synchronized with its parent
    (proc.~\ref{sync}).
\end{itemize}

The increase and decrease handling procedures care about writing back $P$
and further synchronizations.

Note that the increase and decrease handlings might have effect on the
neighbors of $P$, and also on their children and parents.
This means that a synchronization of a node $L$ might have the effect that
the parent $parent(R)$ of some sibling $R$ of $L$ changes.
\end{proc}



\section{Summary}

Compared to traditional fixed-entry-size B-trees, the
presented insertion and deletion procedures are more complex.
The reason is that traditional B-trees do not have to shift
entries from or to the neighbors when a node has under- or overflown.
Even compared to normal B-trees that do this shifting to
reduce the count of nodes in the B-tree, the presented algorithms are more
costly because shifting entries might also affect the upper level of the B-tree
recursively up to the root node.

Besides the high IO costs, this raises concurrency issues because of the higher
number of needed locks.
However, it should be easy to adopt the concurrency protocol proposed by
\cite{Lehman} for traditional B-trees.

The entries can be compressed when req.~\ref{minsize} is relaxed to
\mbox{$deg(N) \geq 2$} for all $N$ except the root.

Obviously, the described B-tree is only suitable for cases in
which much more searches than insertion or deletions occur.
