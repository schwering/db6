A (new) naming convention.
For example,
	100k_disk_rr_mb_none

	  alternative is '1m' for 1,000,000
	* data was written to 'disk'
	  alternative is 'devi' for device file (bypassing file system)
	  alternative is 'vola' for volatile (memory) storage
	* 'rr' script was used, i.e. no debugging but optimization (2)
	  alternative is 'rd' for debugging
	* 'mb' = MacBook Pro was the host machine
	  alternative is 'mm' for Mac Mini
	  alternative is 'pm' for Mike's PowerMac
	  alternative is 'ap' for old IBM Aptiva
	* 'none' means that no row-key compression was used
	  alternative is 'prefix' for prefix compression
