RATIONALE DB.IO.Low_Level

Simple wrapping of system calls via the C-functions open(), read(), write(),
lseek().
Also see C/db-io-low_level.c.

The C code expects HAVE_OFF64_T to be set or not depending on whether on the
system off64_t is defined. If HAVE_OFF64_T is not defined, it defines off64_t
as off_t and lseek64() as lseek().
This is only relevant for seeking in the file. The C code uses lseek64() and
off64_t, of course.
In the Ada code, this requires File_Position_Type to be defined manually to
mod 2**64. Note that really weird errors occur when File_Position_Type and
off_t do not match in size.

There are procedures that allow for locking files on the OS-level (preventing
other processes from opening the respective file). At least under Windows,
locking is not supported and does nothing (not even warn you). On other
OSs, the flock() system call is invoked.
